*   WORDS.SNO -- word counting program
*
*	Sample program from Chapter 6 of the Tutorial
*
*   A word is defined to be a contiguous run of letters,
*   digits, apostrophe and hyphen.  This definition of
*   legal letters in a word can be altered for specialized
*   text.
*
*   If the file to be counted is TEXT.IN, run this program
*   by typing:
*	B>SNOBOL4 WORDS /I=TEXT
*
	&TRIM	=  1
	UCASE	= "ABCDEFGHIJLKMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
	LCASE	= "abcdefghijlkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
	WORD	=  "'-"  '0123456789' UCASE LCASE
	BP = BREAK(WORD)
	SP = SPAN(WORD)
	WPAT	=  BREAK(WORD) SPAN(WORD)

NEXTL	LINE	=  INPUT			:F(DONE)
*	OUTPUT	= '>' LINE
NEXTW
*	LINE WPAT =				:F(NEXTL)
	LINE BP =
	LINE SP =				:F(NEXTL)
*	OUTPUT	= '>>' LINE
	N	=  N + 1			:(NEXTW)

DONE	OUTPUT =  +N ' words'
