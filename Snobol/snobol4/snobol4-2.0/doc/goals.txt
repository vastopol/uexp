Overall goals;
================

Produce a free implementation of SNOBOL4 which is easily portable to
any Un*x machine using the original "Macro Implementation" (MAINBOL).

The target is any 32-bit machine with a good K&R C-compiler, stdio
library and large address space (virtual memory HIGHLY desirable).

Self-compiling.

High performance and a large number of extensions are NON-goal
	you should buy Catspaw SPITBOL (available on a wide range
	of platforms) if you want a professional tool!

Any Extensions should be compatible with those in Catspaw implementations;

	Vanilla SNOBOL4
		PC (8086 and up) port of MAINBOL (free)

	SNOBOL4+
		extended PC SNOBOL4 product

	Catspaw SPARC (et al.) SPITBOL

Treat SIL as source (C output not modified)!!

Goals for 0.5 (Alpha);
======================

Self-compiling (hopefully with working GC)!

Suitable for people with SNOBOL4 experience only!!

No tuning.

SPARC only (assembly language for data segment).

Goals for 0.9 (Beta);
=====================

more portable
	(write data "assembler" to output code to initialize data)

some tuning (do profiling)

Goals for 1.0 (first full release);
===================================

get rid of all awk scripts

working gendep??

tuning & inlining

Future;
=======

re-write gendep!

inlining code generator?
