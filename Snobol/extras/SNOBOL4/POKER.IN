Cold-hand five-card poker between two players with nothing wild.

In cold-hand poker, each player enters an "ante" into the pot and is
dealt a hand (best thought of as a number in the range (0,1)) and the
players take turns betting, checking, calling, raising and folding.
Briefly, checking and betting are done when the pot contains equal
contributions from both players (such as at the start or after a check).
Calling, raising and folding are done when it is up to one of the players
to equalize the pot.  If he calls, there is a showdown.  A raise is a call
followed by a bet.
