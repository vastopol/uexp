* RWORD.inc - RWORD(K) will return a random word with
*	      characteristics similar to other words in
*	      a given corpus.  K is a whole number indicating
*	      the extent to which context is used in forming
*	      the result.  That is, the next character chosen
*	      depends on at most the last K characters already
*	      chosen.
*
*  Variable INPUT must be attached to the given corpus file
*  prior to including RWORD.inc.
