        Permission is granted to incorporate programs on this diskette
        into programs you are developing for any commercial or non-
        commercial purpose.


        Notes on the programs:

        All program sources are in directory \SOURCE
        A Table of Contents file suitable for printing is in \CONTENTS.TXT

        Minor changes have been made in several programs to accommodate
        the 16-bit integers of Catspaw's SNOBOL4+.  For example, the RANDOM
        function now uses real values to compute a value with a reasonable
        period.

        Several subprograms duplicate functions that are built-in to the
        SNOBOL4+ and SPITBOL systems.  These files have been modified to
        contain a GOTO around the defining code, so that the built-in
        definition is not replaced.  Users of other SNOBOL4 systems must
        remove these GOTOs.  The affected files are:

                BREAKX.INC              BREAK with rematch
                LPAD.INC                Left pad string
                REVERSE.INC             Reverse string
                RPAD.INC                Right pad string
                SUBSTR.INC              Extract substring

        In addition, SNOBOL4+ contains built-in functions for natural
        logarithm and exponentiation.  SNOBOL4+ also allows raising a
        number to a real power.  Therefore, the following files have
        been modified with more efficient definitions, using the built-in
        functions and operators.  Users of SPITBOL and other SNOBOL4 systems
        need to remove these changes in files:

                LOG.INC                 Logarithms
                RAISE.INC               Exponentiation
                SQRT.INC                Square root




        Finally, the trigonometric functions in files ARC.INC and TRIG.INC
        can be made more efficient if you have an 8087 or 80287 and are
        using SNOBOL4+.  The SNOBOL4+ diskette contains two assembly-
        language functions, ATAN.COM and TAN.COM that use the numeric
        processor to compute those functions.  The remaining trig functions
        can be derived from the tangent and arctangent.

        Programs have been modified to use the features of SNOBOL4+'s
        INCLUDE control statement.  Functions referenced will be included
        automatically during compilation.  In addition, with Version 2.0
        of SNOBOL4+, redundant INCLUDE's are ignored.  Thus you can
        include two Gimpel programs, each of which includes a third file,
        such as DEXP.INC, with the result that DEXP.INC will only be
        included once.

        You may also take advantage of V2.0 SNOBOL4+'s ability to search
        a specified directory for INCLUDE files.  For example, you could
        place all of the Gimpel files in directory C:\LIBRARY, and use the
        DOS command:

                SET SNOLIB=\LIBRARY

        to instruct SNOBOL4+ to search that sub-directory for include files.
        See page 19 of the SNOBOL4+ Version 2.0 upgrade manual.

        For SNOBOL4+ users, a new version of program CODE.SNO is included.
        The SLOAD function has been modified to process INCLUDE control cards
        in the same manner as the version 2.0 compiler.  Thus you can use
        CODE.SNO to interactively load and exercise the programs on this 
        diskette.  For example, use the SET SNOLIB directive in DOS as
        described above, and run CODE by typing SNOBOL4 CODE.  You can then
        load the QUOTE.INC function by typing:

                SLOAD('QUOTE.INC')

        Any INCLUDE files used by QUOTE.INC will be loaded as well.  You can
        then exercise the QUOTE function interactively.

        A word of caution:  All of these programs assume the space (or blank)
        character is the only white space character.  They do not understand
        the tab character used on personal computers.  Some rework will be
        necessary to accept input containing the tab character.

        A 500-page book, Algorithms in SNOBOL4, by James F. Gimpel, explains
        these programs, as well as describing additional algorithms and
        pattern theory.  The book has been reprinted by Catspaw, Inc., and
        is available from them in both paperback and hardcover format.
