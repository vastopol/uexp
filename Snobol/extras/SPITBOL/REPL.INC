* REPL.inc - REPL(S1,S2,S3) will do a string-by-string replacement
*	     (as opposed to a character-by-character replacement
*	     ala REPLACE) on the string S1.  The string S1 is scanned
*	     for instances of the string S2  and each is replaced by
*	     S3.  Portions of S1 already scanned and the replaced
*	     string are not reexamined for instances of S2.
