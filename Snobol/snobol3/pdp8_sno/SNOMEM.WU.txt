                SNOBOL-8.2 USER'S MANUAL ADDENDUM
                =================================

DATE:  AUGUST 29, 1976
SNOBOL VERSION 93
SNORTS VERSION 51



     SNOBOL-8.2 is currently available as described by the SNOBOL-8.2
user's manual.  This file will outline revisions, restrictions, and
bugs that are applicable to SNOBOL-8.2.  If any other bugs are
discovered, they should be reported to the appropriate person(s), who
is currently Fred Dalrymple.  




KNOWN BUGS
==========
1. If  variables exceed the capacity of field one, 
      unpredicted results will occur. SNORTS performs no checking 
      for this condition.

2. A construction similar to:
        BASE  *BASE*  =
    will cause unpredictable results.

3.      BASE  *STR/N*  POSR
   will not give the desired result that:
        BASE  **  *STR/N*  POSR
   will. (Get the last N characters of BASE into STR)





SNOBOL EDITS
============

(93)    fix output file length count, generate error on compile size
        too large, go to OS/8 when done.

(92)    Finish fixing PAL mode statements

(91)    Line termination standard, compiler version number at
	location zero.

(90)    Start to fix PAL mode statements

(89)    Fix internal page organization

(88)    Fix page size computation, indirect name usage, assignment
	statement

(87)	Finish standardizing '/', get paper tape input working

(86)    Standardize '/' as comment delimiter.  Add .PUSH and .POP.
        arithetic operations. attempt to get papertape input working.



SNORTS EDITS
============

(51)    Fix indirect name calls

(50)    Fix pattern matching backup with fixed length fillers, add
	RESET USR call to INIT.

(48,49) Fix internal labeling, POSR bug

(47)    Fix POSR, XXPVR access - SNORTS.PR modification

(46)    Fix ASC and INT

(45)    Fix anchor mode with or at start, version number at location
	zero.

(44)    Line termination standard

(43)    Fix two page writes, pattern matching filler size with write

(41,42) Fix WRITE and .OCLOSE problems.

(40)    Fix PUSH(J), POP(J) operation.

(39)    Standardize internal calling table.  MAke room for and add new
	.PUSH and .POP constructs. Extend the size of the pushdown table to
        32 entries.
