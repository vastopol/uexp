compilers tried: gcc, clang, gcc std=c99, gcc std=c11, gcc std=c89
-------------------------------------------------------------------

changes made to files:

* including of libaries
  * stdlib.h
  * stdint.h

* add error code to exit() so now it is exit(1)

* rename strstr() to _strstr() so not conflict with C built-in function

* rename getc() to _getc() so not conflict with C built-in function

* rename free() to _free() so not conflict with C built-in function

* rename div() to _div() so not conflict with C built-in function

* rename alloc() to _alloc() so not conflict with C built-in function

* this in sno1.c:

	struct node *freespace &end;
	struct node *freelist 0;
	int	*fault -1;

	becomes:

	struct node *freespace;
	struct node *freelist = 0;
	int	*fault = 0;

* change k&r declarations to c89

* add function declarations to sno.h

* filled in all types (may or may not be correct)

* undoing

------------------------------

resolve type errors...

in sno2.c: space, start, comp, m, as, a, l, r, 
in sno3.c: a, c
in sno4.c: op, a2

------------------------------

adding type casts : (struct node*)(intptr_t) || (int)(intptr_t)
uses intprt_t from stdint.h

fin, fout, flush errors in sno1.c && sno4.c

errors such as:
sno1.c:(.text+0xa7): undefined reference to `fin'
sno1.c:(.text+0xd4): undefined reference to `fout'
sno1.c:(.text+0x207): undefined reference to `flush'

change: extern fin, fout -> FILE *fin, *fout;

change: open() -> fopen(), use "r"

change: flush() -> fflush(stdin)
