SNOBOL3 Interpreter for the Burroughs B5500

This implementation of SNOBOL3 was written by John Chambers at the
University of Wisconsin. The source was apparently obtained from CUBE
library tape CUBEA13, file SNOBOL/L200010.

A user manual is available at
http://bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/B5000_5500_5700/listing/

The compiler and test program were originally transcribed by Rich
Cornwell of North Carolina, US.
