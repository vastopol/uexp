Usage:

The interpreter is setup as a Java jar file named "s3.jar", with jsnobol3.Snobol3 as the main class (defined in the jar manifest file). 
Invocation can either be the usual form for executing jar files or a direct invocation of the main class.

    java -jar s3.jar [<options>] <program>
    or
    java -classpath s3.jar jsnobol3.Snobol3 [<options>] <program> 

The possible option flags are as follows. Boolean options (such as -exec) may be preceded by "no" (e.g., "-noexec") to negate the flag.

-envfile <filename>
    Specifies a file from which to read additional options. 
-debug
    Provide some levels of debug output. 
-stacktrace
    Dump a Java stacktrace on fatal errors. 
-exec
    Cause the compiled program to execute. The "-noexec" flag will prevent execution. 
-mode
    Equivalent to including a "MODE()" function call at the beginning of the program. 
-dquotes
    Allow programs to use double quotes as well as single quotes. 
-escapes
    Allow string constants to include standard escape sequences such as '\n' or '\u00ff'. 
-lint
    Provide some extra checking to detect such things as potential fall thru into a function body.

hand wavy conclusions based on using jsno:
* Text should be at least one space from left column
* Lables must be aligned on the left column, no spaces
* the keyword END makes program crash
* I/O is buggy, all of it: SYSPOT, SYSPPT, stdout, stdin, stderr
