This project and all code included is in the public domain.


Introduction
------------

This is a compiler and runtime-system for a dialect of John Backus'
"FP" language. The compiler ("fpc") is written in FP and does fully
self-compile. FP code is translated to C and can then be compiled to a
binary executable. The compiler processes a single file including any
support libraries - it is a "whole-program" compiler and statically
resolves all functions. The generated C code uses `gcc`-specific
extensions.


Requirements
------------

The system has so far been tested on the following platforms:

* Linux/x86
* Linux/x86-64
* Mac OS X 10.4/PowerPC
* Windows Vista

You will need

* `gcc`, the GNU C Compiler


Building
--------

To build the compiler, enter:

    sh bootstrap.sh

on UNIX-like systems or

    bootstrap.bat

on Windows.

This will compile a pretranslated version of the compiler
(`fpcboot.c`) and perform a 3-stage bootstrap, comparing the output of
the stage 2 and 3 compilers to ensure everything works correctly. As a
result, the `fpc` executable is generated which is the final compiler
to be used. You can now use the compiler from the build directory.
For proper installation, see below.


Installation
------------

If you want to install the compiler in a particular location to be
able to use from anywhere in your system, it has to be configured to
use the correct include files and prelude. The settings where the
support files should be installed are specified in a source file of
the compiler called `configuration.fp`. Edit this file and modify the
paths like this:

    % configuration.fp
    
    configuration = {
      cflags = ~"-I<PREFIX>/include"    % i.e. "/usr/local/include"
      prelude = ~"<PREFIX>/prelude.fp"  % i.e. "/usr/local/share/fp/prelude.fp"
      cc = ~"gcc"                       % change, if not in PATH
      limit = ~5
    }

Then rebuild the compiler with (omit the leading "./" on Windows
systems):

    ./fpcboot -c fpc.fp -prelude prelude.fp

Now copy all necessary files into the proper places, on UNIX (changing
"<PREFIX>" to the right installation prefix):

    install -m755 fpc <PREFIX>/bin
    cp -r fp <PREFIX>/include
    mkdir -p <PREFIX>/share/fp
    cp prelude.fp <PREFIX>/share/fp


Syntax highlighting for Emacs
-----------------------------

A very simple emacs-mode for FP is available in "misc/fp-mode.el".  To
install it, add the following code to your emacs startup file (usually
"`~/.emacs`"):

    (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/fp-mode.el")
    (setq auto-mode-alist
      (append 
       '(("\\.fp\\'" . fp-mode))
       auto-mode-alist) )
    (require 'fp-mode)
